    <h2>How Does Sass Work?</h2>
    <p>A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into
        standard CSS.</p>
    <p>This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and
        then get some CSS code back.</p>
    <section class="tip">
        <span class="tipna"> Tip:</span> Transpiling is a term for taking a source code written in one language and
        transform/translate it into
        another language.
